Creating software to function similar to the API. You may not sublicense an API for use by a third party, and you may not create a Developer Application that functions substantially the same as the API.

End User Data. If you collect end-user personally identifiable information through your Developer Application(s), you agree you will: (i) comply with all applicable privacy laws and regulations, (ii) post a privacy notice that you make easily accessible to users from within your Developer Application(s) in which you clearly and accurately describe your practices for collecting, using, and sharing end user personally identifiable information with Adobe and third parties, and (iii) respect your end-users privacy and honor and adhere to your privacy notice commitments.
